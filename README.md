# OpenD6Toolkit
A mobile app for all things OpenD6

Currently this app is just a simple die roller but in the future I plan on adding in a character creator/manager.

I want to allow users to pick the type of campaign they're playing: Adventure, Fantasy, Space etc. and have a character template pre-populated with the following:
 * Appropriate Attributes for the genre
 * Skills for the genre
 * Advantages
 * Complications
 * Special Abilities
 
Once a template has been picked I want to allow users to build characters either using the template system or a point based system.  Ideally, I will have a system that allows for the management of characters.  Load, Import/Export, Save, Delete.
